Notes from Taylor:

- INLA package is not good: While it is faster than MCMC, it is nowhere near as accurate.
- Packages we should use/explore: CARBayes, RStan

code for $$B = D^-1W$$: 
```{r}

D <- rbind(c(1,0,0,0),c(0,2,0,0),c(0,0,2,0),c(0,0,0,1))
W <- rbind(c(0,1,0,0),c(1,0,1,0),c(0,1,0,1),c(0,0,1,0))

d_inv <- solve(D)

d_inv%*%W
```
